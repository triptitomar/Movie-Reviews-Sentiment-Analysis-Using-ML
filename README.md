# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-ML

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews using Machine Learning (ML). The goal is to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on the text provided by users.  
Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **TF-IDF vectorization**, the text data is transformed into numerical features. A **trained ML model** (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) then predicts the sentiment of the review.  
The project is implemented as an **interactive web app using Streamlit**, allowing users to enter a movie review. 

**Key Features:**  
âœ… Accepts user input in the form of a movie review.  
âœ… Preprocesses the text using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  
âœ… Predicts sentiment using a **trained ML model**.   
âœ… A visually appealing **Streamlit UI** with user-friendly interaction.  

This project can be extended to support **neutral sentiments**, use **deep learning models**, or analyze **real-time reviews** from social media and movie databases. ðŸš€
